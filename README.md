# docker-za-razvijalce
Demo material from my (Slovene language) presentation at [Cxncel](http://cancel.si) event. It features a simple three tier application. The demo shows how docker helps in building and deploying the server tiers.

The material is divided into two parts: Sledilec and Docker.

Sledilec contains all the sources while Docker contains metadata and commands required to build and run docker containers (server side).
